## My goals in 2018

[![2018](https://i.gyazo.com/a135822e0e1d0e087b7e57b1fb912a0e.png align="left")](https://gyazo.com/a135822e0e1d0e087b7e57b1fb912a0e)

This was my target six years ago. It didn't go as planned. Now, I'm ready to revive this habit again :)

## What about 2023?

There are a few things for which I am grateful:

1. Relocating from Japan to Singapore has been a pivotal change for our family of four, marking almost 4 years since we landed here. The safe environment and ease of integrating into society have been significant. My children enjoy preschool, and adapting to Singlish has been simpler than Japanese.
    
2. Working with AirCarbon (now ACX), the longest tenure in my career. Receiving the 𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐛𝐨𝐧 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐀𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 for three consecutive years (2021, 2022, 2023) has been a significant achievement.
    
3. My YouTube Channel's growth, with over 2500 subscribers, is largely thanks to my wife's incredible support.
    
4. Parenting has taught me patience and understanding, especially when balancing work and family life.
    

## Look Ahead to 2024

For this year, my "wish list" is grounded in realism:

1. Dedicate more time to family, including 2-3 short, work-free trips.
    
2. Produce content in both English and Vietnamese for my YouTube channel.

3. Deepen my knowledge by reading more IT and software books, like 'Tidy First'.
    
4. Further develop my skills to become a Staff Engineer or Principal Engineer.
    
5. Save and make plans to hire a helper in Singapore for my family.
    

Cheer and Happy New Year!
