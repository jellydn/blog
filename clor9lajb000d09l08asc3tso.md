Today, I'm thrilled to introduce a plugin I've been working on called `hurl.nvim`. As a passionate Neovim user and developer, I wanted to create a tool that seamlessly integrates HTTP request handling into our favorite editor, and thus `hurl.nvim` was born.

`hurl.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that allows you to execute HTTP requests directly from `.hurl` files within Neovim. It's designed to make the API development process more efficient and pleasant, allowing you to see responses immediately without switching contexts.

**Key Features:**

* 🚀 Run `.hurl` files for quick HTTP requests.
    
* 👁️ Multiple display modes: choose between popup and split views for API responses.
    
* 🌈 Fully customizable: set up your environment with a `vars.env` file and customize the output with different formatters for JSON, HTML, etc.
    

I've made sure to include extensive customization options, so you can tailor the plugin to your workflow. Whether you prefer your responses in a split pane or a floating window, `hurl.nvim` has got you covered.

Here's how it looks in action:
