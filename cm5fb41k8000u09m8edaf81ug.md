# **What is Typesafe?**

Type safety is a programming language property that ensures operations are performed on the correct types of data. It eliminates common errors, such as attempting to perform arithmetic operations on a string or accessing properties that do not exist on an object.

## **Why is Typesafety Important for JavaScript/TypeScript?**

**JavaScript** is a dynamically typed language, which means that type-related errors can often go undetected until runtime. This can lead to bugs that are difficult to trace and fix. **TypeScript**, a superset of JavaScript, introduces static typing, allowing developers to catch type-related errors during the development process rather than at runtime. Hereâ€™s why type safety is crucial for JavaScript/TypeScript development:

1\. **Early Error Detection**: Typesafe code helps catch errors during compile time, lowering the chance of errors when the program runs.

2\. **Improved Code Quality**: Typesafety ensures clear and consistent type definitions, making the code easier to maintain and read.

3\. **Enhanced IDE Support**: Modern IDEs offer better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring tools for typesafe code.

4\. **Documentation**: Types serve as documentation, helping developers understand how to use functions and classes correctly.

# **Introducing the Awesome Typesafe Libraries Repository**

At [Awesome Typesafe Libraries](https://github.com/jellydn/awesome-typesafe): [https://github.com/jellydn/awesome-typesafe](https://github.com/jellydn/awesome-typesafe), I have curated a collection of libraries that emphasize type safety in TypeScript.

Despite its potential, this repository hasnâ€™t garnered much attention yet. I believe this collection can significantly benefit the TypeScript community by promoting libraries that enhance type safety and improve overall development practices.

# **Why Contribute?**

The strength of the open-source community lies in **_collaboration and shared knowledge._** If you know of any libraries that fit the criteria for this curated list, I encourage you to contribute:

1\. **Share Your Discoveries**: If youâ€™ve come across a library that ensures typesafety and isnâ€™t on the list, share it with the community.

2\. **Raise Awareness**: Spread the word about this repository to help it gain traction and become a go-to resource for developers seeking typesafe libraries.

Contributing will help create a valuable resource for the TypeScript community, promote best practices, and improve code quality in many projects.

# **Conclusion**

Type safety is a critical aspect of modern JavaScript and TypeScript development, providing numerous benefits, from early error detection to improved code quality. TheÂ [Awesome Typesafe Libraries](https://github.com/jellydn/awesome-typesafe)Â repository is a valuable resource for finding libraries that prioritize type safety.

Letâ€™s make **TypeScript** development more robust and reliable, one typesafe library at a time!
