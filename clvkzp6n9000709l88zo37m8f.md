#### **Motivation**

Managing multiple side projects and open-source initiatives can be quite a task, especially when they rely on different package managers like Yarn, pnpm, or Bun. Consistently migrating these projects from ESLint and Prettier to Biome, though [straightforward](https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-v1-7/), often becomes time-consuming. This led me to explore a more efficient solution.

Biome-Interactive is a command-line interface (CLI) developed to simplify the migration process to Biome. Built using [charmbracelet/huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) and [Golang](https://go.dev), this tool provides a seamless and straightforward way to both install Biome and migrate settings from ESLint and Prettier with just a single command.

#### **Why** [**Biome**](https://biomejs.dev/)**?**

Biome offers several advantages:

- [**Speed**](https://biomejs.dev/)**:** Biome is significantly faster, reducing the time spent in continuous integration (CI) and during development.
- **Compatibility:** With a high compatibility rate with Prettier, Biome ensures a smooth transition without extensive configuration.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the overhead on your development machine, making it easier and faster to run builds and tests.

#### **How** [**Biome-Interactive**](https://github.com/jellydn/biome-interactive) **Works**

Biome-interactive is built with the user in mind. It requires minimal setup and guides you through the process with interactive prompts.

1. **Installation**:

   ```bash
   curl -sf http://goblin.run/github.com/jellydn/biome-interactive | sh

2. **Usage**: Once installed, simply run `biome-interactive` in your terminal. The tool will guide you through the prompt to initialize Biome and migrate your existing ESLint and Prettier settings.
