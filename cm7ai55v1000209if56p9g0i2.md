Youâ€™ve heard of **Test-Driven Development**, but have you tried **Tab-Driven Development**?

Itâ€™s simple: just `tab tab tab`, and your cursor magically jumps to the next thing to change. Who needs precision when you can just `tab` your way to success?

I first saw this feature in theÂ [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/features)Â editor, and honestly, it was a game-changer. This saves time and understand the content where your cursor at. Itâ€™s extremely useful when youâ€™re refactoring code or repeating some boring/repetitive task.

That was also when I _almost_ made the switch from Neovim to Cursor (a VS Code fork). _Almost._ Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m still a Neovim userâ€¦ ðŸ˜†

Cursor pioneered this feature, but now, every IDE is jumping on board. Recently, VS Code rolled out a similar update:

Other editors like [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) are catching up too:

Even [Zed](https://zed.dev/), my _second_ fa[vor](https://zed.dev/)ite IDE (donâ€™t ask whoâ€™s first ðŸ˜‰), has introduced the **Zeta model** with [edit prediction](https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction).

If youâ€™re curious about my Cursor setup, you can find it here: ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/jellydn/vscode-like-pro](https://github.com/jellydn/vscode-like-pro)

Tab-driven editing is becoming a must-have feature for modern IDEs. Is it life-changing or just a fancy autocomplete? Let me know your favorite!

Cheer and happy coding!
