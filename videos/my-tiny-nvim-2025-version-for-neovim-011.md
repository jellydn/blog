Tiny Neovim Config for 0.11+ – Lightweight, Fast, and Powerful
A slim #Neovim configuration tailored for version 0.11+ with minimal plugins, fast startup, and modern development experience.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/jellydn/tiny-nvim

✨ Why this config?

This setup is a refined migration from https://github.com/jellydn/my-nvim-ide, focusing on:

🚀 Leveraging Neovim 0.11+ Built-in Features
 • No more lspconfig – use native LSP support
 • Ditch mason.nvim – install tools via shell scripts
 • Faster startup and reduced complexity
 • Embrace the latest improvements in Neovim

🔌 Minimal Yet Powerful Plugin Set
 • Only essential plugins for daily development
 • Replaces built-in completion with blink.cmp for a smoother UX
 • Focus on maintainability and performance
