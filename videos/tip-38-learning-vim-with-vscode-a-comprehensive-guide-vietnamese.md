Welcome to my tutorial on learning Vim within the comfort of VSCode! This tutorial series is aimed at users who wish to boost their productivity by leveraging the power of Vim while not leaving the familiar interface of Visual Studio Code.

In this tutorial, I guide you through the process of setting up and using two main extensions, VSCodeVim and VSCode-Neovim, with their respective configurations, key bindings, and features. You will learn how to navigate, edit, and manage your codebase effectively using Vim commands in the VSCode environment.

The repository used in the tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/jellydn/learn-vim-with-vscode

We also explore using LazyVim in VSCode, which provides a streamlined and efficient interface to manage your plugins and configurations. You can find the LazyVim references here:
