Starter Template for Web Developers
nvim-for-webdev is a starter template for #LazyVim that is specifically designed for web developers working with JS, Typescript, React, and Tailwind CSS. It includes a range of useful plugins for Neovim that provide features such as autocompletion, documentation generation, and formatting. The setup also includes the #Codeium plugin, which is a competitor to GitHub Copilot, as well as the #Tabnine autocompletion plugin. Additionally, it includes plugins for sorting Tailwind CSS classes using Rustywind and null-ls.nvim. Users can add extra plugins from #LazyVim, customize keymaps, and set up the IDE with the included resources.
