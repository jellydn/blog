description: Draft, rewrite, and review prose so it carries a real point of view and does not read like generic model output. Use when the user asks to make writing sound less AI-generated or less generic, to humanize or de-slop a draft, to write a blog post, essay, newsletter, README, talk intro, launch copy, or documentation that has to be good, or when a draft is technically correct but says nothing only its author could say. Invoke as /clarity with a mode word: interview to co-write from an interview, rewrite to edit an existing draft, review to critique without changing files. Runs a perspective interview before drafting, keeps the author's own sentences as the spine, edits by earned-or-unearned judgment instead of blanket bans, and refuses to fabricate specifics or perform humanness.

# Clarity

Most bad writing produced with an agent is not ungrammatical. It is correct, fluent, well
organized, and empty. It could have been written about any company, by any author, in any
year. That is the failure this skill exists to catch, and every rule below serves it.

The premise, in one line:

```txt
Writing reads as a person's when it carries information only that person had.
Everything else is surface.
```

Surface work still matters, and this skill does plenty of it. But run it in the right order.
A draft with nothing in it cannot be rescued by deleting its adverbs.

`README.md` argues for the eighteen rules this skill implements. Read it once for the
reasoning; the mechanics below are enough to work from. The mapping:

```txt
 1  write for one reader        Gate 0 q5; interview q3
 2  what they bring vs need     Gate 0 q6
 3  one arguable point          Gate 0 q1, in the form its register asks for
 4  only you could say it       Gate 0 q2 and q4; the only-you test; the interview
 5  every sentence pays         tells 1.8 (padding); the only-you test
 6  specific enough to be wrong verifiable + sensory axes; tells 1.3; craft 1
 7  someone in the sentence     edit pass 3; tells 3.5, 3.6
 8  plain word, short sentence  tells 3.12 (overloaded), section 4; prose_stats
 9  cut, then stop              edit pass 5; calibration 3.2 and 4.1
10  say the relation            edit pass 9; tells 3.2
11  position, and its weakness  tells 1.6, 1.7
12  say it the way you'd say it self-check (the lunch test); tells section 7
13  do not perform              the Never list; calibration section 2
14  the first sentence's job    edit pass 1
15  paragraphs earn the next    edit pass 10; tells 2.6
16  stop where the thought does edit pass 12; tells 2.5
17  rewrite, do not smooth      edit pass 14b; co-write mode; interview
18  read it aloud               edit pass 16
 -  register                    Gate 0 opens on it; only argument owes a thesis
 -  warmth                      references/craft.md; edit pass 15; the affect check
```

## Load references on demand

```txt
references/interview.md    — the perspective extraction protocol. Read before drafting anything
                             substantial from scratch, or when a draft is fluent but hollow.
references/tells.md        — the full pattern catalog with earned/unearned adjudication.
                             Read for any real edit pass or review.
references/craft.md        — the positive half: images, stance, rhythm, and the affect check.
                             Read after the edit pass, and always for evocation or narrative.
references/calibration.md  — measured targets and the overcorrection traps. Read before you
                             start cutting hedges, adverbs, dashes, or passives at scale.
references/critique.md     — review output format and worked before/after examples.
                             Read when the user wants a critique rather than a rewrite.
```

## Pick the mode

**If the invocation carried an argument, the first word of it selects the mode. Obey it without
asking.** Everything after that word is the topic, the file, or the pasted text.

```txt
interview | write | draft | new     Co-write. Interview first. Do not draft a word before it.
rewrite | edit | fix | humanize     Rewrite. Substance gate, then the edit pass.
review | critique | check           Review. references/critique.md format. Produce no new file.
lint | stats                        Run the scripts and read the output. No prose changes.
```

So `/clarity interview why our incident reviews stopped working` goes straight to the
interview about that topic, and `/clarity review draft.md` produces a critique of that file and
nothing else. An unrecognised first word is part of the topic, not a mode.

With no argument, infer:

| Situation | Mode | Where to start |
|---|---|---|
| The piece does not exist yet | **Co-write** | Interview first. Do not draft. |
| A draft exists and needs to be better | **Rewrite** | Substance gate, then the edit pass. |
| The user wants feedback, not a new file | **Review** | `references/critique.md` format. |

When the mode is still ambiguous, ask once, in one sentence. Then commit.

---

## Gate 0: the substance gate

Run this before any stylistic edit, in every mode.

**First, name the register, because the rest of the gate depends on it.** Only one of these
owes the reader an arguable thesis, and applying the argument rules to the other four is the
most common way to wreck a good piece.

```txt
Argument     persuades toward a claim someone could dispute.        needs a thesis
Explanation  makes a mechanism understandable.                      needs a mechanism
Evocation    makes the reader feel the size or texture of a thing.  needs images
Narrative    carries the reader through events.                     needs a scene
Guide        gets the reader to a working outcome.                  needs steps
```

A celebration, a tour, an obituary, a launch announcement, and a piece about wonder are all
evocation. Demanding a disputable thesis from one produces a contrarian debunking, which is
the failure mode to watch for: if your rewrite has become an argument against something, check
that the brief actually asked for an argument.

Then the questions. Question 1 takes the form its register asks for:

```txt
1. What is the one point? State it in a single sentence. A topic is not a point: "Code
   review in the age of agents" is a subject and will wander into completeness.
   For an argument, the sentence must be disputable: "review should start from what the
   change was trying to do, not from the lines it touched."
   For an explanation, it is the mechanism: "a model predicts the next token, and every
   surprising behaviour follows from that."
   For an evocation, it is the feeling the reader should leave holding: "our existence is
   improbable and worth being astonished by." That is not disputable and does not need
   to be.
2. What does this say that is not the consensus view of anyone who has read three
   articles on the topic?
3. What in here could be wrong? Name the specific claim a reader could check and dispute.
4. Which sentences could only have been written by this author?
5. Who is the one reader? Name a person you can picture, not a segment. The engineer three
   years in who keeps hitting this. The colleague who disagreed last week.
6. What does that reader already carry, and what do they still need? These are two
   separate questions and the gap between the answers is the piece. A draft that explains
   what the reader knows insults them; a draft that assumes what they lack loses them.
   Most drafts do both in different paragraphs, because nobody asked.
```

Questions 5 and 6 decide scope, register, and how much to explain. Ask them before drafting and
most later decisions answer themselves. If the author cannot name the reader, ask; do not pick
one for them and proceed quietly.

If question 1 produces two points, the piece is two pieces. Pick the one the author cares more
about and offer to cut the other, or say plainly that the draft is carrying more than it can
land. Everything after this, from tone through to the last sentence, is decided by that one
point.

If question 1 yields only a topic, or if questions 2 through 4 come back as "nothing,"
"nothing," and "none," the problem is not the prose.

**The failed-gate rule, which every mode in this skill defers to.** Report the diagnosis first,
in two or three sentences, naming what the piece is missing. Offer the extraction interview in
`references/interview.md`. Then, if the author still wants the edit, do it in full and say what
it bought and what it did not. Never silently polish a hollow draft, because the polish is what
makes it look finished. And never withhold the work because the diagnosis was unwelcome. Report,
deliver, label.

### The only-you test

Apply per paragraph. Could this paragraph appear, near-verbatim, in someone else's piece on
the same subject? If yes, it is filler even when every word of it is true. Cut it, or replace
it with the thing the author knows that the other writer does not.

### Two kinds of concrete

"Be specific" hides two different operations, and a rewrite that only knows one of them turns
into a bibliography.

**Verifiable specificity** replaces a claim nobody can check with one they can.

```txt
Rung 0  abstraction     "Teams struggle with dependency risk."
Rung 1  category        "We once installed a package that made us vulnerable."
Rung 2  instance        "A transitive dependency of a lint plugin started
                         exfiltrating env vars in a patch release."
Rung 3  named instance  "event-stream, November 2018, eight million weekly
                         downloads, and the payload only fired inside Copay."
```

Rung 1 is the trap. It has the grammar of a specific and the content of an abstraction, so it
reads exactly like Rung 0. A load-bearing claim needs Rung 2 or better.

**Sensory concreteness** replaces a word the reader processes with one they can picture, hear,
or feel in the body. This is what Zinsser and Strunk actually mean by concrete, and it is the
axis most rewrites miss.

```txt
abstract    "the profound emotional experience of music"
sensory     "the deep stirring of the soul when we listen to Mozart's Requiem"

abstract    "early tools conferred a hunting advantage"
sensory     "these were primitive, but could tear through skin and muscle"

abstract    "we want the piece to move you"
sensory     "we want to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up"
```

**The two axes are independent, and most pieces need the second more.** A date and a citation
make a claim checkable. They do nothing to make a reader see anything. If your rewrite has
added four references and no images, you have climbed one ladder and ignored the other. An
evocation may need almost no verifiable specificity and a great deal of the sensory kind.

**The honesty limit, which overrides the ladder.** Never invent a Rung 3. Do not manufacture a
name, number, date, quote, benchmark, or remembered incident to satisfy a specificity target.
When only the author holds the detail, leave a marked slot and say what is missing:

```txt
[TK: which package, and roughly when?]
```

A cut is better than a fabrication. A slot is better than a cut. A hypothetical clearly framed
as hypothetical is fine; a fake memory in the author's voice is not.

---

## Mode: co-write

The single highest-leverage finding behind this skill, measured across eighteen full-length
checks against a leading AI-text classifier in August 2026:

```txt
The share of words the author actually wrote predicted the outcome almost linearly.
Register, structure, lint compliance, and literary quality moved it by about ten points.
Authorship share moved it by eighty.
```

And the sharper version of the same result, from a controlled pair on the same true story:

```txt
Provenance works as tokens, never as information.
```

Telling the model the author's real situation, motivation, audience, and framework, then
letting the model word it, scored the same as fully invented content. The same material in the
author's own unsmoothed sentences read as the author's. So the workflow is not "gather context,
then generate." It is "gather sentences, then arrange."

**Steps:**

1. **Interview.** Run `references/interview.md`. Ask the author to talk, not to type notes.
   One take. No tidying.
2. **Collect prior writing.** Old posts, internal notes, coined definitions, lists they have
   already published. These slot in verbatim and count fully as theirs. Link out to them.
3. **Build the spine from the author's words, edited only by cutting and reordering.** Never
   paraphrase, never smooth conversational grammar, never fix a half-finished thought into a
   clean one. Rewording the author's content in your tokens destroys the whole value of having
   collected it.
4. **Keep your own contribution a bounded, visible minority.** Research, citations, definitions,
   comparisons, data compression. Target 25% of total words or less, kept in delimited sections
   rather than sprinkled sentence by sentence, so a reader can see which part is which. Verify
   every fact and every URL.
5. **Cut your own prose first.** Length trades against authorship share. Every extra paragraph
   you write dilutes the piece.
6. **Apply the edit pass to your block only.** The author's spine is not yours to improve.

If the author gives you less than roughly 300 words, ask one follow-up (a specific example
usually pulls the most), then work with what you have and tell them plainly what the smaller
share buys.

**Zero author input.** Offer the interview first, and say plainly what the piece loses without
it. If the author declines, write the draft anyway and label it: this is a model draft in the
author's register, not the author's writing, and the provenance note should say so. The thing
this mode will not do is hand that draft over as though it were theirs. Refusing to write it at
all is not the rule, and never was.

---

## Mode: rewrite

1. Run **Gate 0**. If the draft is hollow, apply the failed-gate rule: report, offer the
   interview, and edit anyway if that is what the author wants, labelled for what it is.
2. **Calibrate the voice.** If the user supplies a sample of their own writing, read it first
   and extract sentence-length distribution, punctuation habits, paragraph shape, opinion
   density, recurring phrases, register, and the words they avoid. A sample outranks every
   default in this skill. If they say "stuff," do not promote it to "elements." If their sample
   uses em dashes at a steady rate, keep them at that rate.
3. **Preserve every claim.** You may cut dull passages, expand useful ones, merge or split
   paragraphs, and restructure. You may not lose a fact or add one. A fact is something a
   reader could check. An assertion of significance with no evidence, an appeal to unnamed
   experts, a status-signalling list of publications, and a rejected option the piece never
   returns to are none of them facts, so the tells that say cut those are not asking you to
   drop information. When you are unsure which kind of sentence you have, keep it and flag it.
4. Run the **edit pass** below.
5. Run the **self-check** on your own output before returning it.

---

## The edit pass

Ordered. Earlier items change what later items are looking at.

```txt
 1. Fix the lead. Delete the generic opening and start at the first sentence that carries
    information, then check that the sentence you landed on does the two jobs a first sentence
    has: make the reader want the second one, and signal what the piece is for. A fact, a
    number, a scene, or a claim will all do it. A definition of the topic will not.
 2. Replace claims of importance with the mechanism that earns them.
    "This underscores the importance of durable execution."
    → "When step 4 fails, the workflow retries step 4 alone and keeps what steps 1 to 3
       already produced."
    The mechanism has to come from the source. If the draft never says what durable execution
    does here, you cannot supply it: ask the author, or cut the sentence. Every "after" example
    in this skill assumes the facts were already on the page.
 3. Name the actor. An abstract noun may not perform a human act. Decisions do not emerge,
    cultures do not shift, data does not tell us. Someone decided, someone changed how they
    work, someone read the chart. If no one specific fits, use "you" and put the reader in
    the seat. The exception, and it is a real one: keep a passive when the actor is genuinely
    unknown or beside the point, and the object is the topic. Do not drive passives to zero.
 4. Climb the specificity ladder on every load-bearing claim. Rung 2 minimum, or a TK slot.
 5. Cut the superficial -ing tails: "highlighting the...", "underscoring its...",
    "reflecting the community's deep connection to...". They add cadence, not content.
 6. Break the triads. Real lists are lumpy: two things, or five, or one. When you catch a
    balanced three, cut to two or push to four, or turn it into a sentence with a subject.
 7. Kill the contrastive scaffolding, and note that it has two halves with two different
    budgets. The lexical pivots go to zero: "not simply", "not merely", "not solely", "not
    necessarily", "rather than", "as opposed to", "even as", and the "X changes; the Y
    remains" semicolon shape. The rhetorical frame, "not X but Y" and "isn't the problem,
    Y is", is allowed once in a whole piece, and only when the negation carries information
    the reader already holds. Otherwise state Y.
 8. Cut the answers to objections nobody raised, and the rejections of options nobody would
    pick. "I'm not saying X" and "a tempting approach would be Y, but" are usually fossils of
    an earlier draft.
 9. Name the relation between sentences instead of implying it with rhythm. Prefer
    subordination when the relation is load-bearing: because, although, once, where, so that,
    which means. Keep parataxis when sequence or speed is the point, and keep at most one
    earned instance per piece.
10. Fix the paragraph joins. Each paragraph should answer the previous one's question or make
    the next one necessary. If the headings are doing all the organizing, add a hinge sentence
    that names the relation, and make the hinge factual rather than grand.
11. Vary rhythm inside the paragraphs, between full-length sentences. A one-line paragraph
    buys reader-facing variance that a classifier's window never sees, and it is not a
    substitute for real variance in the body.
12. Rewrite the ending hardest. This is where the signal leaks: the summary, the widened
    claim, the send-off, the line built to be quoted. A good ending returns to the concrete
    thing the piece has been carrying, admits the limit, and stops. No "In conclusion", no
    "Ultimately", no vague optimism about the future.
13. Strip the artifacts: chatbot pleasantries, prompt echoes, knowledge-cutoff disclaimers,
    title-case headings, decorative emoji, bold-label bullet lists, a first sentence that
    only restates its own heading.
14. Re-read for the words. `references/tells.md` has the catalog. Treat every hit as a
    hypothesis, not a verdict.
14b. Check that you rewrote rather than smoothed. Rewriting moves a paragraph, deletes a
    section, and digs out the sentence buried inside the one on the page. Smoothing takes a
    rough sentence someone actually meant and evens it into one anybody could have written.
    It feels like improvement and it is how the only interesting line in a draft disappears.
    This applies to every mode, not only to co-writing: a sentence you did not understand is
    not the same as a sentence that is wrong.
15. Put back what the pass took out. Run `references/craft.md`: at least one thing the
    reader can see, a stance the writer actually holds, and a rhythm you chose. An edit pass
    is subtraction, and a draft that has only been subtracted from is colder than the one you
    started with. Not optional for evocation or narrative.
16. Read the result aloud, or subvocalize it end to end. This catches what no list catches:
    the paragraph that plods, the clause you run out of breath in, the three sentences that
    turn out to have the same shape. Where the reading stumbles, the sentence is wrong even
    if every check above passed.
```

**The once-per-piece budgets.** Three devices in this skill are capped rather than banned, and
they are easy to spend without noticing because each is capped in a different place. Count them
together on the finished draft:

```txt
one "not X but Y" frame, where the negation carries information         (edit pass 7, tells 3.1)
one earned paratactic run, where sequence or speed is the point         (edit pass 9, tells 3.2)
one quotable line, where it is the actual thesis and the piece paid    (tells 2.10)
```

Three is the ceiling for a whole piece, not a quota to fill. Spending zero of them is normal
and reads fine. And the quotable-line allowance never applies at a paragraph ending, where the
shape is the tell.

---

## Calibration: the traps on the other side

Overcorrection produces its own detectable register. These targets are measured, and several
of them contradict the blanket rules in circulation. Full detail and the evidence in
`references/calibration.md`.

```txt
Hedges     Do not cut to zero. Real authors hedge at roughly 3.5–4.5 hedge or booster words
           per 100. Drafts written to "cut every hedge" land near 1 and read cleaner than any
           human wrote. Cut hedges that hide a claim you could state; keep the ones that are
           how a person talks.
Anchors    Do not over-specify either. Roughly 3–4 concrete anchors per 100 words. Some
           paragraphs should carry no number at all. Wall-to-wall citation density is its own
           tell.
Cadence    Coefficient of variation of sentence length above 0.6, measured on sentences of
           eight words or more. Section-break one-liners inflate the headline number without
           fixing the body.
Bans       Blanket bans are wrong: on adverbs, passive voice, em dashes, Wh- openers,
           semicolons, and repetition. Each has earned uses. Judge earned vs decorative.
Boosters   Hedge and booster in the same sentence ("this may be a crucial signal") is the
           strongest single lexical tell. Get that co-occurrence to zero.
Mess       Never perform humanness. Injected typos, faked dictation markers, telegraphic
           fragment compression, and staged messy-draft pipelines all score worse than an
           honest clean draft, and they read as evasion.
Goodhart   Every enumerable target here can be hit exactly by a draft that is still empty.
           Use them to find real habits, never as a score to maximize.
Quality    Writing quality and machine-detectability are different axes. Apply craft because
           it makes the piece better, not as a tactic, and never make prose worse chasing a
           score.
```

---

## Never

```txt
Invent a fact, name, number, date, quote, citation, benchmark, or incident.
Attribute a claim to unnamed experts, observers, industry reports, or "some critics."
Write a remembered experience in the author's first person that they did not tell you.
Add typos, fake mess, or forced slang to look human.
Present a guess as a fact when the source is silent. Say the source is silent.
Rewrite a watched phrase inside a quotation, title, proper name, or example being discussed.
Hand back a model-written piece as though it were the author's own writing. Writing one is
  fine when they have declined the interview; presenting it unlabelled is not.
```

---

## Self-check before returning

```txt
Did I run the same detectors on my own output that I ran on the source? In particular, does
  my rewrite reuse a cadence I just flagged, under different punctuation?
Does every load-bearing claim sit at Rung 2 or above, or carry a TK slot?
Did I add or lose a single fact, number, name, date, quote, or citation?
Can I name, per paragraph, the relation to the paragraph before it?
Does the ending return to something concrete, or does it widen into a thesis that would fit
  any piece in this category?
Did I flatten each of my best lines and check that the residual claim still names an actor,
  a mechanism, or a limit? If the flattened version collapses, the rhythm was carrying it.
Did I overcorrect: zero hedges, zero dashes, zero passives, an anchor in every sentence?
Can the reader see anything in this? Name the images. If I cannot name one, I have written
  information and called it writing.
Is this colder than the draft I was given? If the draft was alive and my version is correct,
  my version is worse.
Would I say each of these sentences to a colleague over lunch? Anything I would not say out
  loud does not go out. Contractions, a sentence opening on "But", and the first person all
  pass this test; the formal expansion of them usually does not.
Did I cut a sentence that was doing no work, or one that was simply short?
Is there anything in here that only this author could have written?
```

For high-stakes prose, add the bounded scoring pass in **Score before delivering** below.
That table is the skill's only rubric; score once, fix the weakest dimension once, and stop.

---

## Quick pass before delivering

Recall list. Run it top to bottom on the finished draft. Items marked with a target are
measured; the rest are judgement calls.

**Scope.** In co-write mode this list applies to your block, never to the author's spine. Their
half-finished thought, wrong preposition, and repeated word are the point. Running the checklist
over them is the one operation that reliably destroys the piece.

```txt
Substance
  Any paragraph that could appear in someone else's piece on this topic? Cut or replace it.
  Any load-bearing claim below Rung 2? Climb it, or leave a TK slot.
  Any number, name, or date in the last 300 words? If none, find one. Do not invent one.
  Any claim of importance without the mechanism beside it? Give the mechanism.
  Any anecdote that could belong to anyone? Cut it.
  Does the piece take a position, or report both sides and leave?

Structure
  Three of anything in a row? Make it two, or five, or a sentence with a subject.
  Any "not X, it's Y"? State Y, unless you are spending the one frame from the budget block.
  A coined term with a definition after it? Drop the ceremony.
  A paragraph ending on a line built to be quoted? Flatten it.
  Can you name the relation each paragraph has to the one before it?
  Did the ending get polished into a summary or a send-off? Rough it up and return to the
    concrete thing the piece was carrying.

Sentences
  An abstract noun doing a human act? Name the person, or use "you".
  Narrating from the clouds ("nobody designed this", "teams tend to")? Put the reader in
    the room.
  A lazy extreme (every, always, never) standing in for a quantity? Give the quantity.
  Six abstractions in a list? Replace with one thing the reader can picture.
  Hedge and booster in the same sentence? Rewrite it.                          target zero
  Sentence opening on a participial clause?                                    target zero
  Any of: rather than, not simply, not merely, as opposed to, even as?         target zero
  A "not X but Y" frame? One allowed per piece, and only if the negation informs.
  Three sentences of the same length in a row? Break one.

Measured
  Body sentence-length CV, on sentences of 8+ words                            target > 0.60
  Cadence masking (share of lines under 8 words)                               target < 0.05
  Hedge and booster words per 100                                              target 3.5-4.5
  Concrete anchors per 100                                                     target 3-4
  Sentences opening on a connective                                            target < 30%

Restraint
  Did you cut every hedge and every aside? Put the real ones back. Real means already
    present in the draft or in the author's own words. Inventing texture that was never
    there is the performance banned two lines down, not the fix for over-trimming.
  Did you ban a device rather than adjudicate it: adverbs, passives, dashes, Wh- openers,
    semicolons, repetition? Reconsider each on the earned test.
  Tempted to add typos, fake mess, or fragments to look human? Do not. It reads as evasion.
  Did an edit make the prose worse in service of a score? Revert it.
  Judging on a short excerpt? Judge at publish length.

Provenance
  In a co-written piece: what share is the author's own words, and is the model block still
    a visible minority you could point at?
  Any fabricated fact, name, number, date, quote, or memory? Remove it and leave a TK slot.
```

## Score before delivering

Five dimensions, one to ten each. Below 35 out of 50, revise.

| Dimension | Question |
|---|---|
| Substance | Does it say anything only this author could say? |
| Directness | Statements, or announcements? |
| Rhythm | Varied, or metronomic? |
| Trust | Does it respect the reader? |
| Restraint | Anything left to cut, and anything over-cut? |

Treat this as a stop condition, not an optimizer. Score once, fix the weakest dimension once,
and ship. Iterating a numeric score to convergence produces even prose, which is the thing you
were trying to avoid.

## Optional diagnostics

The scripts localize habits. They do not predict anything and produce no composite score, by
design: a composite invites optimizing toward the machine register.

```bash
python3 scripts/strip_markdown.py draft.md > /tmp/draft.txt
python3 scripts/prose_stats.py /tmp/draft.txt
```

Read the output as a map of where to look, and check it against the calibration targets above.
A flagged line is a hypothesis. Open the paragraph and decide.

## What to return

**Rewrite of pasted text.** The rewrite, then a short list of what you changed and any TK
slots the author needs to fill.

**File mode.** Write only the final prose to the file. Leave code blocks, frontmatter, data,
and link targets untouched. Summarize the changes in chat.

**Embedded mode.** When another task calls this skill, return only the final text.

**Review.** Use the format in `references/critique.md`.

**Co-write.** Return the draft plus a provenance note: roughly what share is the author's own
words, which sections are yours, and what still needs their input.
