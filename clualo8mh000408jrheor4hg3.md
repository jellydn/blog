Software maintenance can often feel like a boring/time-consuming task. You're not alone. But what if I told you there's a magical tool that could change all that? Meet [`grit`](https://www.grit.io/), new best friend in the coding world promises to turn the tedious task of software development into something you might enjoy.

Grit is like your personal software maintenance superhero, handling those tedious code migrations, dependency upgrades, and backlog tasks that you've been avoiding.

**TLDR**:  
\- Run `grit init`  
\- Use the below config if you are working with Javascript/Typescript

```yaml
version: 0.0.2
patterns:
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_console_log
    tags: ["logging"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#prefer_early_return
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_async_promise_executor
    tags: ["code-quality", "promise"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_prototype_builtins
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#no_throw_literal
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#replace_wildcard_imports
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
  - name: github.com/getgrit/stdlib#unused_imports
    tags: ["code-quality"]
    level: warn
```

- Run `grit check` command to see the matching between patterns with your project.
- Run `grit apply PATTERN_NAME` command, e.g: `grit apply no_console_log`

## What Makes Grit So Special?

Grit isn't just another tool; it's a revolution in how we approach software maintenance. With its unique combination of machine learning and static analysis, Grit is all about making your life easier by automating the mundane parts of coding.

## Why it's useful

With Grit, those days spent on monotonous maintenance tasks are over. It's not just about saving time (though you'll save a lot of it); it's about improving your code's quality and consistency without lifting a finger. Grit seamlessly integrates into your workflow, whether you're in GitHub, VS Code, or the command line, offering a unified experience that feels like magic.
