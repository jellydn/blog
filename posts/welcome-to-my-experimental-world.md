# Hello there

Currently, I work at [AirCarbon](https://aircarbon.co/) as a Software Engineer. I often get into something new and always feel exciting when trying with hot technology.

For upcoming posts, I will write some short articles which are `TIL`(Today I learned) and some dedicated articles about website development. Hopefully, you would find something useful for you on my blog.
